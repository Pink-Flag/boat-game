This is our entry for the js13k games competition 2022. The theme this year is DEATH.

You are Charon, ferryman of Hades, and you are tasked with transporting souls across the river form the land of living to the land of the dead.

You collect the souls from the right bank of the game and take them to the dock on the left. Avoid the monsters and ghost ships! Collect boosts to regain energy.
